# SESPHR: A METHODOLOGY FOR SECURE SHARING OF PERSONAL HEALTH RECORDS IN THE CLOUD
# Introduction
# The increased adoption of cloud-based services in the healthcare sector has led in the cost-effective and convenient exchange of Personal Health Records (PHRs) among many e-Health system participants. Nonetheless, keeping personal health information on cloud servers exposes it to disclosure or theft, necessitating the development of procedures that safeguard the privacy of PHRs.

# As a result, we offer SESPHR, a methodology for safe PHR sharing in the cloud. The SESPHR approach ensures patient-centric control over PHRs while maintaining PHR confidentiality. Patients store encrypted PHRs on untrusted cloud servers and provide access to different sorts of users on different portions of the PHRs selectively. Setup is a semi-trusted proxy.
