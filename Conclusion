# We proposed a methodology to securely store and transmission of the PHRs to the authorized entities in the cloud. The methodology preserves the confidentiality of the PHRs and enforces a 
patient-centric access control to different portions of the PHRs based on the access provided by the patients. We implemented a fine-grained access control method in such a way that even 
the valid system users cannot access those portions of the PHR for which they are not authorized. The PHR owners store the encrypted data on the cloud and only the authorized users possessing 
valid re- encryption keys issued by a semitrusted proxy are able to decrypt the PHRs.
The role of the semi-trusted proxy is to generate and store the public/private key pairs for the users in the system. In addition to preserving the confidentiality and ensuring patient-centric 
access control over the PHRs, the methodology also administers the forward and backward access control for departing and the newly joining users, respectively. Moreover, we formally analyzed and
verified the working of SeSPHR methodology through the HLPN, SMT-Lib, and the Z3 solver. The performance evaluation was done on the on the basis of time consumed to generate keys, encryption and
decryption operations, and turnaround time. The experimental results exhibit the viability of the SeSPHR methodology to securely share the PHRs in the cloud environment.
